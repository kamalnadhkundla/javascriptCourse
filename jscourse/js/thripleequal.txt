// java script takes everyting as var 
example:
 var user ="2";
 
 if(2== user){
     console.log("executed event though user is string because java scripts considers everything as var only to overcome this we use
     "===" to identify the type");
 }

 correct example 
 var user ="2";
 
 if(2===user){
    comsole.log("it doesnot execute);
 }

 check the conditional.js for execution.
